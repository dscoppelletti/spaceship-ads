# Module spaceship-ads

Spaceship for AdMob.

* [AdMob](http://www.google.com/admob)

This library is no longer being maintained just like
[Consent SDK](http://github.com/googleads/googleads-consent-sdk-android).
Maybe the [User Messaging Platform SDK](http://developers.google.com/admob/ump/android/quick-start)
could prove better.

Anyway complying GDPR and other laws of that bunch stated around the world is a
pain and likely the advertising revenue does not pay the effort - maybe it does
to a software company, but surely it does not to an individual programmer.
